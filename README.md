Strategies for Lobsterland Amusement Park 

Lobster Land serves as the backdrop to most of the marketing analytics.It is a fictional theme park, based in southern Maine, approximately 90 minutes from Boston by car. Lobster Land has the basic sorts of things that we might expect to see at a seaside amusement park â€“ rides, food, souvenirs, places for visitors to simply relax, and an arcade with video games and other types of amusements. Each year, the park opens on Memorial Day and closes on Labor Day.Lobster Land maintains a low-key, unpretentious seaside atmosphere. While the park is wholesome, clean, and takes pride in the professionalism of its staff, it also remains affordable and accessible to a large swathe of the local population.
